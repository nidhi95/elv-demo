                <div class="sub max-width">Jewellery is the work of true artists; it involves
                    individually sculpting and refining the adjustments to house the stones perfectly. The shaping of
                    the invisible parts is essential to ensure that the visible parts are as beautiful and radiant as
                    possible. This is the sign of the greatest jewellers.
                    Our designers continually revisit the themes that Elvee holds. They draw inspiration from a strong
                    historical legacy and modern themes with a wide range of styles reminiscent of the many facets.
                    Each Elvee design plays on the fluidity of materials and the radiance of light, thanks to the
                    exceptional talent of our team and gem-setters. Each Elvee design gives way to a new emotion: from
                    diamond drops that trickle down the neck, quivering foliage that embellish and frame the face and
                    the firework-like explosion of gems.

                                At the Elvee's production house, designers, gemmologists and gem-setters work together

                                A piece of jewellery is being created at Elvee's largest High Jewellery workshops. A
                                drawing is created and contours are revealed little by little. The carefully studied
                                architecture begins to take shape, and gold is then painstakingly sculpted, adjusted,
                                polished and buffed to reveal all of its glory. This is the moment of grace when the
                                piece of jewellery comes to life. </p>

                                The gold is enhanced by the brilliance of gemstones that a gem-setter sets with
                                precision to perfectly showcase their beauty. Elvee’s know-how not only focuses on
                                refining the diamonds, it also explores methods that make the most incredible pieces
                                possible. Beading, pavé, bezel, and prong settings are some of the techniques used to
                                enhance the sparkle and create exquisite refinement. Manpower works on Elvee at each
                                step of the diamond jewellery making process to guarantee consistently supreme quality
                                and finishing on every part of the jewel. Once the work of gem-setter completed, each
                                gemstone is checked individual.</p>
