                <div class="sub max-width-craft">The ELVEE philosophy for craftsmanship centres on minimalism.
                    With meticulous research and diligent persistence we have perfected the art of using the least
                    amount of metal in our designs so that the precisely hand-picked diamonds shine to their best
                    advantage.
                    Manpower works on Elvee Jewels at each step of the diamond jewellery making process to guarantee
                    consistently supreme quality and finishing on every part of the jewel.

                                Casting is one of three primary processes used to make jewelry. The process has been
                                used for millennia because it allows goldsmiths to make just about anything they can
                                imagine and itâ€™s versatile. Lost wax casting is an ancient, versatile process that
                                allows you to make just about anything you can imagine. But it also requires very high
                                heat, torches, high-silica plaster, and a learning curve.</p>

                                Manual work is required to gather the metal components together, in order to create the
                                final jewellery. If the arms of the mounting are too sharp-edged, the operation of
                                crafting is repeated all over again. This step is a very meticulous and demanding one:
                                it ensures the longevity of the creation.</p>

                            <p>
                                Every part of the jewellery, even the most hidden ones, is hand-polished, leading to an
                                overall brilliance .The light may then fully penetrate through the openwork and release
                                the stones beautiful colour. The metal almost vanishes, putting forward the stones. </p>

                                The Maison Elvee selects very carefully the stones that will be set on each jewellery.
                                The wide colour palette and the little extra soul they feature intensely the purest
                                sentiments. Experience is infinitely important in a good gemstone setter. As part of
                                their highly demanding jobs. The process begins with a purely aesthetic appraisal.</p>

                            <p>
                                The gemstone setter places the selected stones into the pre-formed setting. Using his
                                burin, cutter and presser, he ensures that the gemstones fit tightly. Every gem should
                                be displayed in its best light. The prongs must be bent in such a way that they cannot
                                be felt when a hand is run over the finished piece. Gemstone setting is an exclusively
                                manual job. </p>
